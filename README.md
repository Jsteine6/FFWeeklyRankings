# FFWeeklyRankings
I have been a fan of the NFL for years. My family and I are huge Falcons fans, so I lack a good team to invest my cheers in. Because this, I tried Fantasy Football so I could have a different team to cheer for. This is where my code comes in. It will calculate each players weekly stats and tabulate injuries on a specific team to determine rankings.
I will also utilize snap volume, target share, and route participation to bolster the accuracy of the rankings.
